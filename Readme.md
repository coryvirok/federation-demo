## Apollo Federation Demo

This repository is a demo of using Apollo Federation to build a single schema on top of multiple services. The microservices are located under the [`./services`](./services/) folder and the gateway that composes the overall schema is in the [`gateway.js`](./gateway.js) file.

### Installation

To run this demo locally, pull down the repository then run the following commands:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all of the dependencies for the gateway and each underlying service.

```sh
npm start
```

This will start up the gateway and serve it at http://localhost:4000

### What is this?

This demo showcases some microservices running together in the same process... Because microservices are a good idea for code separation, and an overly complicated idea for process isolation...

To see the query plan when running queries against the gateway, click on the `Query Plan` tab in the bottom right hand corner of [GraphQL Playground](http://localhost:4000)
